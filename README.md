# Nordic Combined

Here are some ideas on how to visualize the simualtion:

1. Still image. Work, but not very clear.
2. Video like [time_vs_distance](./time_vs_distance.mp4). Better(?) but takes very long to render. It took me about >2h to render the simple simulation.
3. Video like [athlete_distance](./athlete_distance.mp4). Only works on video format. Thanks to multiprocessing is fast => need ffmpeg to fuse the images in a single video after.
